What do you understand by the universal sector?

Ans:-


Universal selectors

The CSS universal selector (*) matches elements of any type.

The universal selector is a special type selector and can therefore be namespaced when using @namespace. 

This is useful when dealing with documents containing multiple namespaces such as HTML with inline SVG or MathML, or XML that mixes multiple vocabularies.

ns|* - matches all elements in namespace ns

*|* - matches all elements

|* - matches all elements without any declared namespace
