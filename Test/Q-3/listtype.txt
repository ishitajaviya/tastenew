List in HTML helps to display a list of information semantically.

There are three types of lists in HTML

1. Unordered list or Bulleted list (ul)
2. Ordered list or Numbered list (ol)
3. Description list or Definition list (dl)

(1.)  Unordered List or Bulleted List

In HTML unordered list, the list items have no specific order or sequence. 

An unordered list is also called a Bulleted list, as the items are marked with bullets. 

It begins with the <ul> tag and and closes with a </ul> tag. 

The list items begin with the <li> tag and end with </li> tag.

(2.)  Ordered List or Numbered List (ol)

In HTML, all the list items in an ordered list are marked with numbers by default instead of bullets.

 An HTML ordered list starts with the <ol> tag and ends with the </ol> tag.

 The list items start with the <li> tag and end with </li> tag.

 (3.) Description List or Definition List

  the list items are listed like a dictionary or encyclopedia.
 
  Each item in the description list has a description.
  
   You can use a description list to display items like a glossary. 
   
   You will need the following HTML tags to create a description list:

<dl> (Definition list) tag – Start tag of the definition list

<dt> (Definition Term) tag – It specifies a term (name)

<dd> tag (Definition Description) – Specifies the term definition

</dl> tag (Definition list) – Closing tag of the definition list
