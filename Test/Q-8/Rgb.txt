What is meant by RGB stream?  set a background color of webpage using RGB stream?

Ans:-

RGB represents colors in CSS. 

There are three streams in this nomenclature representing a color, namely the Red, Green, and Blue streams. 

The intensity of colors is represented using numbers 0 to 255. This allows CSS to have a spectrum of visible colors.

These three colors can be in form of numbers (0 to 255) or percentages.

RGB(255, 0, 0) or  RGB(100%, 0, 0) is RED, as red is set to its highest value.

RGB(0, 255, 0) or  RGB(0, 100%, 0)  is GREEN, as green is set to its highest value.

RGB(0, 0, 255) or  RGB(0, 0, 100%) is BLUE, as blue is set to its highest value.
