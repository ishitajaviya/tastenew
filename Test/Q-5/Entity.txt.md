HTML provides some method to display reserved characters. 

Reserved characters are those characters that are either reserved for HTML or those which are not present in the basic keyboard. 

For instance, ‘<‘ is reserved in HTML language.

Sometimes this character needs to display on the web page which creates ambiguity in code.
